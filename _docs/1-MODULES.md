# Modules

Pinguino's functionality is organised into modules. Each module is disabled by
default, and can be enabled and configured using the [dashboard](/dashboard).

Pinguino has the following modules, each of which has their own documentation
page:

- `Announcements` - provides important updates about the bot.

- `Fun` - provides a variety of fun commands.

- `Quote` - provides starboard-like functionality.

- `Moderation` - provides moderation commands like `ban` and `kick`.

- `Moderator Utility` - provides useful commands to be used by moderators.

- `User Utility` - provides useful commands to be used by users.

- `Role` - provides a role management system so users can give themselves
  configured roles.

- `Tags` - provides a system for users to use tags created by moderators.

- `Phishing` - automatically scans links and flags them if a phishing link is
  detected.

- `File Paste` - checks for files uploaded to messages and gives the option to
  upload the file to [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com/), so they can be viewed by
  mobile users.
